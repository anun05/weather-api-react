## Description
Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. The challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.The goal in this Weather API was to work as a weather tracking system, just like any other. However, in this case I aslo used react to make it more modern.
